# DockerSamples

Docker is a platform for containerization that simplifies the process of packaging, distributing, and running applications in isolated environments known as containers. It enables consistent deployment across different systems, reducing compatibility issues. Docker utilizes images, which are lightweight snapshots of application and environment configurations. Containers created from these images are isolated and share the host OS kernel, making them efficient and portable. 

Docker Hub provides a repository for sharing and pulling pre-built images. Docker Compose allows defining multi-container applications in a single configuration. While Docker streamlines development and deployment, orchestrators like Kubernetes manage the scaling, networking, and load balancing of containerized applications. Overall, Docker revolutionizes software deployment by enhancing consistency, flexibility, and resource utilization.

This repository provides a set of sample files that go in hand with the articles written on my medium blog Docker 101
